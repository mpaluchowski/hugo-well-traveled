# Well Traveled Hugo Theme

Well Traveled is a minimal theme for Hugo---the static website generator. Originally built for use at https://travel.paluchowski.com/, my travel blog.

Its focus is mainly on:

* excellent readability on any device,
* support for high quality photos,
* content organization by subsequent travels I've undertaken.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your `/themes` directory, ie.

```shell
$ cd /your/hugo/site
$ git clone https://github.com/mpaluchowski/hugo-well-traveled themes/well-traveled
```

Build the [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) files from `/assets/css` into `/static/css`:

```shell
$ sass --no-source-map --style=compressed --update assets:assets
```

Then tell Hugo to render your site with the theme:

```shell
$ hugo --theme=well-traveled
```
